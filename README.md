This repo is the answer of Cermati coding challenge.

### Special Notes:
- Please run `$ pod install` after downloading it from email. It should ensure the podfiles are installed correctly for the project.
- Please use `develop` branch to review my answer and run the projects in Simulator/Real Device.

### Functional Requirements:
- [x] Write the unsplash app in Swift 5  
- [x] It must be compilable using most recent XCode Production Version
- [x] It must be runnable on all 3-4 most recent iPhone versions
- [x] There should be a text search bar for searching images
- [x] The CollectionView must be an adaptive collection view with 2 columns and infinite scroll e.g. if youâ€™ve run out of image in page 1 then it must automatically fetch page 2 images, and so on. Feel free if you want to use the most recent Apple SDK named SwiftUI, we allow this because Apple is pushing this new UI SDK to future iPhones. DO NOT use external library for this custom collection view!
- [x] Each image must have loading progress when in fetching state.
